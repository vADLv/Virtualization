# Virtualization
Create Container

The idea of work is to:
-	understand in practice the concept of a container. 
-	learn and test namespaces and cgroups concepts by using Ubuntu bash and C languages. 
-	clarify the difference between our container created by clone() and docker container.


to run this code:
- download v2.c
- gcc -0 v2 v2.c
- ./v2

For proper work and to have time to test some features getchar() is used a few times in this code. Just press any button a few times to finish it.
